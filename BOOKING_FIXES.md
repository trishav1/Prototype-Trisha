# Booking System Fixes - What I Changed

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Google Calendar Not Updating (Step 5)
**Problem:** The calendar API call had no error handling. If it failed, the entire booking would fail.

**Solution:** Added try-catch around the Google Calendar event creation so:
- Errors are logged to console
- Booking continues even if calendar fails
- You can see the error: `✗ Google Calendar API failed: [error message]`

### 2. ✅ Customer Not Getting Email
**Problem:** No error handling for email failures. Customer emails should be sent but there was no visibility into failures.

**Solution:** 
- Added try-catch around Resend email sending
- Added try-catch around SMTP email sending
- Added detailed console logging so you can see:
  - `✓ Emails sent via Resend: {customerEmail, ownerEmail}`
  - `✓ Emails sent via SMTP: {customerEmail, ownerEmail}`
  - `✗ Resend API failed: [error]` (if it fails)
  - `⚠ No email provider configured` (if neither is set)

## What You Need to Check

### A. Email Configuration (REQUIRED for customer to get emails)
You must have ONE of these configured in `.env.local`:

**Option 1: Resend (Recommended)**
```
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=bookings@yourmail.com
```

**Option 2: SMTP (Gmail, SendGrid, etc.)**
```
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your@email.com
SMTP_PASS=your_password
SMTP_FROM=your@email.com
```

### B. Google Calendar Configuration (REQUIRED for calendar updates)
You must have these in `.env.local`:
```
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-service-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY=-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID=your-calendar-id@gmail.com
BOOKING_OWNER_EMAIL=owner@email.com
```

### C. Owner Email (REQUIRED for owner to get notifications)
```
BOOKING_OWNER_EMAIL=owner@email.com
# OR
BOOKING_OWNER_EMAIL_ADDRESS=owner@email.com
```

## How to Debug

1. **Check the server logs** when you create a booking:
   - Look for `✓` (success) or `✗` (error) messages
   - This will tell you exactly what's happening

2. **Test email configuration**:
   - Make sure `RESEND_API_KEY` + `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` are set OR
   - Make sure `SMTP_*` variables are all set

3. **Test Google Calendar**:
   - Check if `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` is properly escaped (newlines as `\n`)
   - Check if `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID` is correct (get it from Google Calendar)

## What Gets Sent Now

| Recipient | What They Get | When |
|-----------|---------------|------|
| **Customer** | Booking confirmation with details | After step 5 (if email configured) |
| **Owner** | Full booking details for processing | After step 5 (if email configured) |
| **Google Calendar** | Calendar event with customer as attendee | After step 5 (if credentials set) |
